A openFrameworks addon for creating Video Buffers

ofxVideoBuffer is an addon for openFrameworks (v0.8.0+) that allows users to record a series of images from the screen and temporarily, it also enables users to play these images back like a video.

It was used as part of the Playable City 2014 Award project - Shadowing.

If you would like to contribute to the addon feel free to fork, hack and mod the code.
Also drop me a line and let me know how you end up using the addon.
